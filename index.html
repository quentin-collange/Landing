      <h2> MEET OUR TEAM ! </h2>

      <p> Let me introduce you to our brand new team, 4 players who have just retired and will be ready to teach you the basics of tennis, or help you progress to the highest level. 

        Novak Djokovic : 17 grand slam, this former Serbian player will be ready to make you revise the basic strokes of tennis, like forehand and backhand.

        Rafael Nadal: 20 grand slam tournaments, he will teach you how to move on his favorite surface, clay courts. 

        Roger Federer : With 20 grand slam counters, Roger will help you stay calm on the court, and may even offer a paid training session to teach you how to move your game on grass.

        Jo-Wilfried, our 4th and last coach, will be more adapted if you don't speak English or Spanish, because even if he was already world nÂ°5, he is not at the level of our first 3 coaches.</p>
